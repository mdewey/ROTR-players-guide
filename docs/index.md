### Quick How-tos

#### Roll dice

Use the chat command. There is a `3d Dice` plugin that you can customize for your own dice

``` bash
/roll 1d10
```

#### Ping on the map

- Click and hold on the map
- I believe this is also configurable via the `Module Settings`

#### Character Sheet

Feel free to use the built in character, I have heard its nice, but I have played with it much. Guides and stuff are online

### Tips and tricks

- If its lagging, then change the framerate in the settings to low. This is Pathfinder, not Call of Duty
- In the Settings, especially the module settings I recommend looking at settings for the flowing modules and playing around with them
  - Dice so Nice
  - Pings
  - Zoom/Pan options (I switched mine to `touchpad` and never looked back)
- If you come across modules that look cool, we can install them
- THe Marcos are JavaScript based. :shrug: sounds fun
